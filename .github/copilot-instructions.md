# What's this about?

I'm creating a project that I want to use with my kids to learn programming. 
This is basically based on Turtle geometry, and Mindstorms.
I'm an experienced developer, but let me know things that I might not know about.

## Project

I want to use Vanilla JS SPA, with web components in the browser.

## Instructions for Copilot

* Let's try to use the latest ES6+ features.
* Use web components for the UI.
* Use the latest web APIs.
* I use Pico CSS for styling but we can add additional styles if needed.
* Use Vitest for testing, and try to keep tests close to the browser environment.
